### User Stories:

### **HTML**

1. Add a **div** element with **class="container"**. This div will contain all the content of the page.

2. Within the container, add an **image** corresponding to the product or service you chose. For example, in the demo above, I added the RadicalX logo.

3. Add an **h1** element for the "Frequently Asked Questions" title.

4. Each FAQ should contain a **div** element with **class="stack"**, as well as an **input** element with **type="radio"**, **name**, and **id**.

5. For each FAQ, add a **label** element, an **h2** element for the FAQ number, and an **h3** element for the question title.

6. Add a **div class="container"** for each answer.

7. Each answer should be within a **p** element.

### **CSS**

1. Use the **@import url** rule to style the page font.

2. Make sure you use **display: flex**, **transition**, **:hover**, **:checked**, and **::after** in the styling.

3. For each FAQ, add a **"+"** sign using **content: "+"**.

4. Use **transform: rotate()** to transform the **"+"** sign into an **"x"** sign once the FAQ is opened.
